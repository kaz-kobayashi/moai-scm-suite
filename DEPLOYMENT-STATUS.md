# SCMOpt Deployment Status Report

## Current Issue
The application is experiencing deployment failures on Google Cloud Run due to an architecture compatibility issue.

### Error Analysis
- **Error**: `failed to load /bin/sh: exec format error`
- **Cause**: Docker images built on Apple Silicon (M1/M2) are not compatible with Cloud Run's linux/amd64 architecture
- **Attempts Made**: 
  - Added `--platform=linux/amd64` to Dockerfile
  - Used `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64`
  - Created simplified test versions
  - All attempts result in the same exec format error

## Application Components Ready for Deployment

### ✅ Frontend Components
- Google OAuth authentication implemented
- API provider switching (Ollama/Gemini) 
- Complete React TypeScript application with Material-UI
- All components tested locally

### ✅ Backend Components  
- FastAPI application with all notebook functionality ported
- Complete REST API endpoints for ABC analysis, VRP, inventory optimization
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Health check endpoints

### ✅ Docker Configuration
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized builds
- Static file serving for React frontend
- Environment variable configuration
- Health checks configured

### ✅ Google Cloud Configuration
- Project: `moai-scm-suite` configured
- Container Registry configured  
- Cloud Run service configured
- IAM policies configured (with organization restrictions)

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use GitHub Codespaces or Linux Environment
Deploy from a linux/amd64 environment to avoid architecture mismatch:
```bash
# In GitHub Codespaces or Linux VM
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t gcr.io/moai-scm-suite/scmopt:production .
docker push gcr.io/moai-scm-suite/scmopt:production
gcloud run deploy scmopt --image gcr.io/moai-scm-suite/scmopt:production --region asia-northeast1
```

### Option 2: Use Alternative Cloud Platforms
Consider deploying to platforms that support multi-architecture:
- **Railway**: Supports automatic Docker deployment
- **Render**: Good for full-stack applications  
- **Fly.io**: Supports multi-region deployment
- **Vercel**: For frontend with serverless functions

### Option 3: Local Development Setup
The application runs perfectly in local development:

```bash
# Backend
cd webapp
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend  
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Access at `http://localhost:3000` with backend at `http://localhost:8000`

## Files Ready for GitHub Repository

All necessary files are prepared and ready for GitHub upload:

- **Application Code**: Complete frontend and backend
- **Docker Configuration**: Multi-stage Dockerfile with platform specification
- **Deployment Scripts**: `deploy-to-cloud-run.sh` with full automation
- **Documentation**: Complete installation and deployment guides
- **Configuration**: Environment variable examples and setup instructions

## Next Steps

1. **Upload to GitHub**: All files are ready for repository creation
2. **Choose Alternative Platform**: Select deployment platform that supports current architecture
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up automated deployment from GitHub
4. **Production Configuration**: Configure environment variables and secrets

The application is fully functional and deployment-ready - only the architecture compatibility with Google Cloud Run from Apple Silicon machines needs to be resolved.
